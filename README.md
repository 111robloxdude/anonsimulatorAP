Anon Simulator for Manual Archipelago

This is a very basic apworld to be used with brantsteele's big brother interactive template.

"Anon" is just a ORG hosted by me and basically is friend group jargin, this will work with any setup of characters in your bransteele but the checks only work with a 20 person cast atm
